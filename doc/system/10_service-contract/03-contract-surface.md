# 3. Contract Surface

## Phase 1 contract set

The current contract surface covers:

- intake request
- extraction result
- retrieval package
- handoff envelope
- service status
- embedded diagnostics

## Intake request

The intake contract requires explicit source identity, source class, artifact request type, normalization mode, and observation posture.

Observation defaults to denied.
If a watcher is requested, it must be contract-scoped, operator-visible, removable, and bounded by source class.

Runtime Slice 1 now executes this contract mechanically through schema-backed intake validation.
The runtime output remains limited to accepted or denied validation truth plus bounded contract-error paths.

## Extraction result

Extraction results are syntax-only by contract.

They must expose:

- provenance
- completeness posture
- freshness posture when relevant
- refusal posture when requests cross into semantics or other denied boundaries

Runtime Slice 2 now emits bounded extraction-result outputs for supported local `.md` and `.txt` sources only.
Unsupported, unreadable, malformed, or intake-invalid inputs fail closed through `denied` or `unavailable` extraction results.
Empty text-like sources are now denied rather than treated as empty success outputs.

Runtime Slice 5 adds one bounded local PDF lane only.
That lane admits text-layer `.pdf` files, remains text-only and non-OCR, allows `ready` only for trustworthy extractable text, allows `partial_success` only when some pages lack extractable text, denies encrypted or text-layer-free PDFs, and marks corrupt or unreadable PDFs unavailable.
The PDF lane has since been hardened for admission truth.
It now exposes a structured host admission probe (`probe_pdf_lane_admission()`) that reports per-tool presence of `pdfinfo` and `pdftotext` separately so downstream consumers can distinguish which tool is absent.
The lane eligibility path now uses probe-derived summaries rather than a static dependency message when tools are missing.
The extraction path now distinguishes malformed or corrupt PDFs (detected via `pdfinfo` or `pdftotext` stderr structural-error patterns) from generic tool invocation failures, giving each a specific operator-visible summary.
No OCR path or external service fallback exists or is implied at any failure state.

The extraction runtime now also uses a shared source-lane framework for lane admission, shared provenance metadata, shared failure posture, and admitted-lane reporting.
Runtime Slice 6 adds one bounded local DOCX lane only.
That lane admits local `.docx` packages, remains syntax-only, recovers headings only from explicit paragraph-style evidence, recovers simple lists and bounded table text only when deterministic, denies comments or tracked changes, and marks corrupt or unreadable packages unavailable.
Runtime Slice 7 adds one bounded local RTF lane only.
That lane admits local `.rtf` files, remains paragraph-only, supports basic escaped character recovery only as needed for honest plain-text extraction, denies annotation, review, field, media, and other rich destinations outside the lane, and marks corrupt or syntactically untrustworthy sources unavailable.
Runtime Slice 8 adds one bounded local ODT lane only.
That lane admits local `.odt` packages, remains syntax-only, recovers headings only from explicit `text:h` structure, recovers simple lists only from explicit `text:list` structure, recovers bounded table text only when row and cell order are deterministic, denies annotations, tracked changes, and embedded object/media structures, and marks corrupt or structurally untrustworthy packages unavailable.
Runtime Slice 9 adds one bounded local EPUB lane only.
That lane admits local `.epub` packages, remains syntax-only, establishes package truth through EPUB mimetype, container, manifest, and spine authority, recovers headings only from explicit XHTML heading structure, recovers simple lists and bounded table text only when deterministic, denies active content, navigation documents in the admitted reading path, and media-bearing content structures, and marks corrupt or structurally untrustworthy packages unavailable.
The text baseline is now documented explicitly alongside the richer lanes rather than remaining only an implicit runtime truth surface.

## Retrieval package

Retrieval packages are:

- non-canonical
- non-semantic by default
- freshness-bound

They require explicit retrieval profile, freshness, invalidation, and completeness fields.
They do not decide ranking, canonical truth, or downstream semantic acceptance.

Runtime Slice 3 now emits one governed retrieval-package path from ready syntax-only extraction output only.
Chunking remains deterministic and syntax-derived, using section-bounded chunks when available and paragraph fallback only when no section structure exists.
Ready PDF extraction results remain compatible with this path through the same paragraph-bounded fallback rather than any PDF-specific semantic shaping.
Ready DOCX extraction results remain compatible with the same path through section-bounded chunking when explicit heading structure exists.
Ready RTF extraction results remain compatible with the same path through paragraph-bounded chunking only.
Ready ODT extraction results remain compatible with the same path through section-bounded chunking when explicit heading structure exists and paragraph-bounded fallback otherwise.
Ready EPUB extraction results remain compatible with the same path through section-bounded chunking when explicit heading structure exists and paragraph-bounded fallback otherwise.

## Service status

Service status exposes truthful operator-visible state with the narrow Phase 1 vocabulary:

- `ready`
- `degraded`
- `unavailable`
- `denied`
- `stale`
- `partial_success`

It remains an operational truth surface only.
It does not become a raw-content channel or downstream coordination surface.

Runtime Slice 4 now emits one governed service-status path from bounded local runtime truth only.
It reports implemented runtime slices, admitted source lanes, zero active watcher scopes, and ready/degraded/unavailable posture without adding recommendation or control-plane behavior.
The admitted-source-lane report is now driven from the shared lane registry rather than ad hoc extraction-module inspection.
Special-track runtime slices implemented without lane admission may appear in implemented-slice reporting only; the current example is Scrivener Stage 1 authority recon.
Future lane work is now expected to pass a reusable admission playbook before implementation begins.

## Handoff envelope

The handoff envelope is a bounded transfer-truth surface only.

It may express:

- `ready_for_transfer`
- `denied`
- `stale`
- `integrity_failed`
- `re_prep_required`

`reverse_signal` is optional.
When present, it must stay within the bounded reverse-signaling enum and must not become a workflow protocol.

It must reject orchestration-shaped fields such as:

- `retry_count`
- `workflow_id`
- `queue_name`
- `dispatch_plan`
- `agent_assignment`

## Embedded diagnostics

Embedded diagnostics are now schema-backed rather than prose-only.

They are:

- redacted by default
- limited to Cortex-owned operational truth
- allowed to expose bounded state, freshness, integrity, completeness, watcher scope, and denial summaries

They must reject content-exposure shapes such as:

- `raw_content_preview`
- `full_text_preview`
- `full_text_search`
- `content_browser`
- `raw_artifact_dump`

## Implemented schema layer

The current machine-checked schema inventory is:

- `schemas/intake-request.schema.json`
- `schemas/extraction-result.schema.json`
- `schemas/retrieval-package.schema.json`
- `schemas/service-status.schema.json`
- `schemas/handoff-envelope.schema.json`
- `schemas/embedded-diagnostics.schema.json`
