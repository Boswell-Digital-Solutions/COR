# 2. Boundaries and Doctrine

## Authority line

Cortex owns:

- intake contracts
- syntax-level extraction
- provenance and completeness signaling
- retrieval-preparation support
- handoff packaging support
- freshness and invalidation signaling for Cortex-owned artifacts
- privacy-preserving diagnostics for Cortex-owned surfaces

Cortex does not own:

- semantic interpretation
- model authority
- workflow sequencing
- retry or queue semantics
- executor selection
- downstream execution ownership
- canonical business truth
- broad surveillance authority

## Doctrine line

The governing doctrines are:

- service-only visibility
- syntax before semantics
- fail closed over convenience
- retrieval infrastructure, not retrieval authority
- explicit invalidation over assumed freshness
- default-denied observation
- bounded reverse signaling only
- informational service status, not control-plane behavior

## Cross-service boundaries

### DF Local Foundation

Provides substrate support.
Does not absorb Cortex file-intelligence logic.

### NeuronForge Local

Consumes syntax-level packages for semantic work.
Does not make Cortex a semantic authority.

### FA Local

Owns policy-gated execution routing.
Does not delegate execution authority into Cortex.

## Anti-drift warning

Any proposal that turns Cortex into a semantic surface, workflow router, retry coordinator, surveillance surface, status-control plane, or generalized transform sink should be rejected unless the architecture is explicitly reworked.

No automatic next slice is implied by the current runtime baseline.
Further runtime expansion must be explicit, narrow, and grounded back to the constitutional plan.
